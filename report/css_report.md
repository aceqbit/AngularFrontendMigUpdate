# CSS Report

## Modernization Recommendations
- The project uses a single global stylesheet (`styles.css`). For better maintainability and to leverage component-scoped styles, it is recommended to move component-specific styles to their respective component's CSS file.
- The project is now using the `application` builder, which uses Vite. No compatibility issues were found with the current CSS.

## Sass Transition Log
- The project does not use Sass.

## Risk Audit
- Low risk. The CSS is simple and does not use any complex features that would be affected by the migration.
