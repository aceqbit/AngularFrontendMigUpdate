# Migration Assessment Report

## 1. Incremental Sequence Audit

### package.json
- Angular version is 16.2.0.
- TypeScript version is 5.1.3.
- `rxjs` version is 7.8.0.
- No major issues found for migrating to Angular 17.

### angular.json
- The builder is `@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser`, which is the legacy builder. This will need to be updated to `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application` in Angular 17.
- `test` builder is `@angular-devkit/build-angular:karma`, which is deprecated.

### tsconfig.json
- `target` is `ES2022`, which is compatible with Angular 17.
- `module` is `ES2022`, which is compatible with Angular 17.
- `moduleResolution` is `node`, which is compatible with Angular 17.

## 2. File Analysis

- No usage of legacy APIs that are removed in Angular 17 were found in the scanned files.
- The project is using NgModules.

## 3. CSS Assessment

- The project uses global styles in `styles.css`. No major issues are expected, but a review is recommended after the migration to the new builder.
