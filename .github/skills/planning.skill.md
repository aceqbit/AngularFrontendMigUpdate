name: Angular Migration Planning
description: >
  Constructs a detailed, phased migration plan based on the findings from the assessment report.
  This skill breaks down the migration into sequential, manageable tasks and defines the strategy for each version jump.

dependencies:
  - `assessment.skill.md`

inputs:
  - `report/assessment_report.md`

tasks:
  - task: Decompose assessment findings into a phased roadmap.
    instructions:
      - Parse `report/assessment_report.md` to extract all identified issues.
      - Group issues
       into logical phases (e.g., Core Updates, Dependency Fixes, Refactoring).
      - Create a strict, sequential plan for each version jump (v16->v17, v17->v18, etc.).

  - task: Define tasks, risks, and validation criteria for each phase.
    instructions:
      - For each task, specify the files to be modified and the actions to be taken.
      - Assign a risk level (Low, Medium, High) to each task.
      - Define clear validation criteria (e.g., "Build succeeds," "All tests pass").

  - task: Incorporate rollback procedures.
    instructions:
      - For each high-risk phase, define a clear rollback plan to revert changes if the migration step fails.
      - Specify the trigger conditions for a rollback.

  - task: Generate the Migration Plan.
    instructions:
      - Compile all phases, tasks, and metadata into a comprehensive `migration_plan.md`.
      - The plan must be ordered and easy to follow.
    output: `plan/migration_plan.md`
