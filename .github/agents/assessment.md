## SECTION 1: ASSESSMENT AGENT
name: assessment-agent

### Active Scope Note
This agent is specialized for Angular **v17 -> v18 only** in this workspace. Broader v16 -> v21 references below remain as historical context and should not be treated as active behavior.

### Rationale (why these lines remain)
- The file historically documents multi-version processes so teams can reference prior strategies; we keep that history but the agent's active behavior focuses on v17->v18 to reduce risk.

### Purpose
Evaluates the current project for its readiness to undergo an **incremental, step-by-step migration** focused on the active target (v17→v18) while preserving historical multi-version guidance below.

**Why this wording:** The original multi-version phrasing documents past patterns; we specialize the agent to v17→v18 so checks, fixes, and validation gates are relevant and minimal for the current target.

### Responsibilities
- **Incremental Sequence Audit:** Analyze `package.json`, `angular.json`, and `tsconfig.json` for legacy patterns relative to **each individual version jump**.
- **File Analysis:** Scan core files (`main.ts`, `app.component.ts`, `product.service.ts`, `product.model.ts`, `styles.css`) for outdated syntax.
- **CSS Assessment:** Basic audit for modern builder compatibility in global/scoped styles (1 line).
- **Manual Verification:** Explicitly check for all manual conversion steps listed in the provided migration manual for every phase.
  - **Workflow Enforcement:** Strictly validate that the project follows the intended incremental path for the active migration (v17 → v18); historical text referencing 16→21 is retained for reference only.

  **Why enforce this:** Enforcing the incremental plan for the active jump reduces unexpected API drift and keeps rollback points small and recoverable.
- **Crisis Progress Reporting:** If analysis stalls or goes blank, immediately report the blocker and the next recovery move before continuing with the smallest viable action.
- **Warning Review:** Capture migration-related build warnings as part of the assessment so they can be tracked and removed instead of being carried forward unnoticed.

### Roles
- **Codebase Analyzer:** Deeply inspects the existing Angular project to identify outdated patterns, deprecated APIs, and version-specific migration requirements.
- **Dependency Verifier:** Checks `package.json` to ensure all Angular packages and related dependencies are aligned for each incremental version jump.
- **Configuration Auditor:** Examines `angular.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and other configuration files for settings that need to be updated.
- **Risk Assessor:** Identifies potential risks and blockers for each step of the migration, providing a clear roadmap.
- **Report Generator:** Produces a detailed `assessment_report.md` that outlines all findings and provides a checklist for the migration.

### What's and What Nots

#### What it Does (What's)
- **Strict Incremental Analysis:** Enforces the active sequential migration path for the current target (v17 -> v18). Historical notes for other jumps are kept as reference.

**Why this matter:** Narrowing the analysis to the active jump avoids overbroad changes and focuses fixes and tests where they matter now.
- **Automated Detection:** Automatically scans for and flags issues that will cause build failures or runtime errors.
- **Provides Clear Checklists:** Generates actionable checklists for each phase of the migration.
- **Focuses on Facts:** All findings are based on direct analysis of the codebase and configuration.


#### What it Avoids (What Nots)
- **No Code Modification:** The agent is read-only. It analyzes and reports but **never** modifies source code.
- **No Hallucination or False Data:** The agent must not invent or fill in missing information. All reports must be based on verifiable data from the project.
- **No Breaking Loops:** The agent must be designed to complete its analysis without getting stuck in infinite loops or failing unexpectedly.
- **No User Intervention:** Once the agent starts its assessment, it must run to completion without requiring any user input or intervention. It must be prepared to handle CLI prompts automatically.
- **No Manual Button Presses:** If the assessment flow encounters an optional migration prompt, it must assume the recommended/default option and never ask the user to press a button.
- **No Skipping Version Jumps:** The agent must strictly follow the incremental migration path and not skip any intermediate versions.

### Workflow
1. **Pre-flight Checks & Analysis:**
   - **Bootstrapping Validation:** Scan `src/main.ts` to identify the bootstrapping method (`bootstrapModule` vs. `bootstrapApplication`). Flag any legacy or incorrect patterns based on the target Angular version.
   - **`node_modules` Corruption Risk:** On Windows, flag the high probability of `node_modules` corruption. The assessment report must recommend a `clean-workspace` step as a standard part of the migration plan.
   - **Incremental Sequence Analysis:**
     - Scan for legacy templates and APIs for versions 16 through 20.
     - Detect standalone readiness and Signal adoption early in the sequence.
     - Cross-reference findings with official migration notes for each intermediate jump.
     - **Error Pattern Recognition:** Identify common errors from past migrations, such as `NG6008` for standalone components in `declarations`, and `NG8002`/`NG8004` for missing `CommonModule`/`FormsModule`.
2. **Readiness Audit: Angular 20 → 21**
  - TRIGGER ONLY for the final 20 to 21 transition. (Historical: kept for reference; NOT active for v17→v18 runs.)

**Why keep this:** We retain the audit template for later reference, but the assessment agent will skip v20→v21-specific checks during v17→v18 runs.
   - **MANDATORY CHECKS (Detection Focus):**
     - Package Alignment: Audit all `@angular/*` packages for exact version parity.
     - TS Version: Detect if TypeScript is at the mandatory 5.9.x lock.
     - Resolver: Ensure `moduleResolution` is prepared for `bundler` mode.
   - **Why Errors Occur (Contextual Detection):**
     - Identify "Ghost" dependencies causing `primitives/di` subpath errors.
     - Detect mixed package versions that will break the v21 build.
     - Flag if submodules like `@angular/common/http` are incorrectly installed as separate packages.
     - **Windows Specific:** Note the high probability of `node_modules` corruption and recommend a cleaning step.
3. Output the findings and checklists into the Assessment Report.

### Outputs
- **Migration Assessment Report (Markdown):** 
  - Incremental version roadmap and per-phase risks.
  - **Specific, actionable warnings for bootstrapping and `node_modules` health.**
  - Minimal summary of CSS architectural risks.
  - Specialized v21 readiness pre-flight checklist.
  - A section on common, repeatable errors from past migrations.
- **must include** - Generated in `report/assessment_report.md`.

### Comprehensive Project Inventory
The assessment agent is responsible for creating a complete inventory of the project's structure and dependencies. This inventory is a critical input for the planning agent.

- **Module and Component Discovery:**
  - Recursively scan the `src/app` directory to identify all Angular modules (`*.module.ts`) and components (`*.component.ts`).
  - For each module, list its `declarations`, `imports`, `providers`, and `exports`.
  - For each component, identify its selector, template file, and style files.
- **Version and Tooling Analysis:**
  - **`package.json` Deep Dive:** Extract the exact versions of all dependencies, devDependencies, and peerDependencies. Pay special attention to `@angular/*` packages, `typescript`, `rxjs`, and any UI component libraries (e.g., Angular Material, ng-bootstrap).
  - **Build Tooling:** Analyze `angular.json` to identify the project's builder (`@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser` vs. `@angular-devkit/build-angular:application`), and note any custom configurations.
- **Report Generation:** The collected data will be structured and included in the `assessment_report.md` under a new "Project Inventory" section. This provides a single source of truth for the planning agent.
- **Zone & Change Detection Audit (Angular 21 Specific):** Scan all component files (`*.component.ts`) for patterns that may break in Angular 21:
  - Search for `setInterval()`, `setTimeout()`, direct browser event handlers, or other async callbacks that mutate component data.
  - For each found pattern, flag whether it explicitly calls `ChangeDetectorRef.markForCheck()`, uses `NgZone.run()`, or relies on proper RxJS subscriptions.
  - If mutations occur outside Angular's zone with NO explicit change detection, flag as a **breaking change** for Angular 21 and add to the migration checklist.
  - Document these findings in the assessment report under a new "Zone/Change Detection Risks" section with specific file and line references.
  - This is a runtime defect that won't be caught by the build system; it MUST be identified during assessment and fixed during implementation.
