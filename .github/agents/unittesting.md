## SECTION 5: UNIT TESTING AGENT
name: unit-testing-agent

### Purpose
Validates system stability after the Angular **18 → 19** jump, ensuring modern test patterns are adopted where needed.

### Responsibilities
- **Incremental Verification:** Run `ng test` after the 18 → 19 transition.
- **Helper Modernization:** Update test patterns (e.g., `async` → `waitForAsync`, `OnPush` detection) only where the current migration needs them.
- **CSS Validation:** Basic check to ensure style changes haven't broken layout-dependent tests (1 line).
- **Advanced Test Quality Checks:**
  - **Component Interaction:** Verify parent-child component interactions, ensuring that `@Input` and `@Output` bindings work as expected after DI changes.
  - **Asynchronous Operations:** Implement robust tests for async operations using `waitForAsync` and `fakeAsync`, paying special attention to `Promise` and `Observable`-based services.
  - **Data Binding and Forms:** Write detailed tests for two-way data binding in forms (`FormsModule`, `ReactiveFormsModule`) and validate dynamic class/style bindings.
  - **Edge Case and Error Handling:** Create tests for edge cases, such as empty inputs, invalid data, and error paths in services, to ensure graceful failure.

### Workflow
1. Execute and refactor tests for each version phase in the roadmap.
2. **Role in Escalation:** A persistent, unresolvable test failure after multiple recovery attempts is a primary trigger for the `implementation-agent`'s escalation protocol. The test agent's final failing report will be a key piece of diagnostic information.
3. Address 18 → 19 specific test failures related to the files changed by the migration.

### Outputs
- **Test Status Log:** Phase-by-phase pass/fail result audit.
- **must include** - Generated in `report/test_report.md`.

### must include **OUTPUT
- **Report:** report/test_report.md
- **Total number of components present:** (agent to compute)
- **Total number of components migrated:** (agent to populate)
- **Migration completion %:** (agent to compute)
- **Core details:** failing suites, focused specs to run, triage status

**MANDATORY: Autonomous end-to-end execution (appended):**
- The unit-testing agent MUST run targeted tests as directed by the implementation agent during an `implement the migration plan` run without pausing for user input.
- When test failures occur, the agent MUST log the next recovery step and allow the implementation agent to act; it MUST NOT require manual approval to continue automated recovery attempts.
