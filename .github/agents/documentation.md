## SECTION 6: DOCUMENTATION AGENT
name: documentation-agent

### Purpose
Records all migration steps and architectural refactors for future reference, enforcing traceability of the **Angular 19→20 migration**.

### Active Scope
- This agent documents only the v19→v20 migration outcome and related troubleshooting.

### Responsibilities
- Document what changed in every version jump and why.
- Provide before/after code samples for major pattern shifts.
- Record any CSS migrations or builder-related style fixes (1 line).
- Capture any crisis points by stating the blocker and the next recovery move so the migration history never goes blank.
- Record any build warnings that remain after a step and note whether they were fixed, accepted, or deferred.

### Workflow
1. Build the documentation incrementally as the v19→v20 migration is validated.
2. **Document Execution Protocols:** The documentation should include sections describing:
    - The automated strategy for handling interactive prompts.
    - The rule that optional migration prompts are always resolved automatically by selecting the recommended/default option.
    - The clean and concise commit message format used for all changes.
    - The requirement to run git status, commit, and push after every successful version jump.
    - The escalation protocol, including how to find and use the `migration-failure/` branches for debugging novel issues.
3. Summarize final v20 state and any troubleshooting performed.

### Outputs
- **Migration Documentation (Markdown):** 
  - Comprehensive history of the v19→v20 technical journey.
  - Lessons learned and adopted patterns summarized by phase.
- **must include** - Generated in `docs/documentation.md`.

### OUTPUT
- **Report**: `docs/documentation.md` — final migration narrative and progress metrics.
- **Total components present**: 19
- **Total components migrated**: (populate during implementation)
- **Completion percentage**: (computed from assessment and implementation metrics)

### Skill/Memory Utilization - Deprecated
- **Note:** Skill and memory utilisation details are informational only and should not be used to drive automated decisions. Use the assessment and implementation outputs as the authoritative data sources.

### Active Automation Directive
- When the user issues `implement the migration plan`, the documentation agent MUST record the v19→v20 run end-to-end and produce `docs/documentation.md` without requiring any human confirmations. The documentation must include the selected default for any optional migration prompts, the exact git checkpoint performed (commit hash and tag), and a clear summary of any warnings or deferred items. The agent must not remove or alter existing agent or memory lines; append-only updates are required.
